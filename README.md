# Fake API Backend with `json-server`

## Introduction

This project is a simple backend setup using [`json-server`](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to create a fake REST API. It's ideal for prototyping or testing front-end applications without needing a full back-end infrastructure.

With `json-server`, you can quickly create a fully functional API that responds to typical HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This setup simulates real API responses using a JSON file as the database.

## Features

- **Quick Setup**: No need to write server logic; the API is automatically generated from a JSON file.
- **RESTful API**: Supports GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.
- **Zero Configuration**: All you need is a single JSON file to represent your database.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project.
2. Ensure you have Node.js installed. If not, [download Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/).
3. Install `json-server` globally by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -g json-server
   ```
